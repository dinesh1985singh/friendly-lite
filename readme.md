## Frequently Asked Questions ##

1. **Is the theme is Gutenberg ready?**

Well, partially. I am working on it to make it fully gutenberg compatible and it would be available very soon in the next update of the theme. 

2. **I have uploaded the header hero image, but it not visible to my site?**

Please make sure you have checked the option "Display hero image?" under **Appearance > Customize > General Settings**. Until you check it, Header Hero image would not be available.
